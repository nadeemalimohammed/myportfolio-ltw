            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, where I developed a strong foundation in software
                engineering, algorithms, and web development. My interest in technology started at a young age, and
                during my studies, I became particularly fascinated by web development and how it enables seamless
                interaction between users and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I’ve immersed myself in the world of full-stack development, constantly learning and
                adapting to the latest web technologies. My experience ranges from front-end design—creating visually
                appealing and user-friendly interfaces—to back-end development, where I work with databases and
                server-side logic. This has allowed me to take a holistic approach to building robust, scalable, and
                efficient applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my technical skills, I’ve worked on various projects that emphasize UX/UI design
                principles, ensuring that users have a positive and intuitive experience. Through internships, freelance
                projects, and full-time roles, I have been able to collaborate with cross-functional teams and
                contribute to both small start-ups and large enterprises.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always eager to learn more and explore new challenges in the fast-evolving tech landscape. My
                ultimate goal is to continue building solutions that not only meet business needs but also provide
                meaningful, user-centered experiences.
